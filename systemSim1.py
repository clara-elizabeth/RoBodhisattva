MORAN PROCESS
Given an initial popu.ation of plahers, the population is itertedin rounds consisting of:
    - matches played between each pair of players, with the cumulative total scores recorded
    - a player is chosen to reproduce proportional to the playerâ€™s score in the round
    - a player is chosen at random to be replaced
The process proceeds in rounds until the population consists of a single player type. That type is declared the winner.
